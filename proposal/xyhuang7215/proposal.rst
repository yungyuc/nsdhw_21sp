===========================
Proposal for SekirOgre
===========================


Basic information
=================

Recently, I enjoy playing Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. So I think it might be
a good and interesting practice to build my own game engine specially for this
kind of action adventure game.

Since it seems hard to make a good renderning engine from scratch, I decide to
use ogre engine (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) , a 3D rendering
engine written in C++. So I can just focus on building other components of
engine, like physics and collision.

Problem to solve
================
   
1. Manage the characters, items and scenes.
2. 


Perspective users
=================

Those who want to build a action adventure game but lack of programming skill.
Maybe a GUI like RPG Maker or Unity.
