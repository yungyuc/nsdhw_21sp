# Proposal for Body IsoSurface

## Basic information

**TODO** GitHub Link

Plot the isosurface with the intensity of body tissue.

## Problem to solve

When humans taking Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT), the computer will 
get the intensity of body tissues. We need some algorithms to visualize the intensity data, and 
isosurface is one of them. By plotting the same value of intensity, we can easily recognize specific 
tissue in the body, and also easily find the abnormal place. In summary, I want to develop a method to 
calculate an isosurface with C++, and maybe provide 3D rendering methods for output triangles.

### Algorithm and Mathematics

- Marching Cubes (**TODO** Explain)

### Target

- Well-Defined Structure
- CI Procedure
- Computation Speed
- 3D Rendering (maybe)
    - Camera
    - Shadow
    - Controllable

## Perspective users

All people who is interested in body tissues, special for doctors who need to read MRI and CT results.
